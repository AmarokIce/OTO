Welcome in OTO Page!

**What This?**

This is a Minecraft Mod for 1.7.10, a solution for Minecraft 1.7.10 instructions.

**What something it will offer?**

More of command! /fill, /setport, /opgive and more! use /otohelp to get them!

**With OMO?**

In fact, I created OTO first, then OMO. OMO is an outlier, but now OTO includes OMO content.

But you can still put OTO and OMO in your mods dir at same time with no conflict.

If you just wanna to have some tp command and wanna lite, OMO is your best chose.

=== Pineapple license ===

I will provide all or part of the code, as long as you use it within the limits of the law, you can use these codes as you like.

You can get full access to this source code without paying any royalties, which will be permanent and irrevocable if you are granted this license.

If you have made a copy of the Program with these code, you should include this license to keep the original code open source.

Of course this license doesn't used in court, just like you know that none of us want legal battles for these meaningless things, so I hope you will respect this brief license.

I do not want my code to be used for commercial purposes, including but not limited to paid downloads.

If you think my mod is good to learn something, if you like, invite me to a cup of pineapple juice.

If you do not follow this simple agreement and legal liability arises, this has nothing to do with me, please take responsibility for yourself.

If you're selling my source code or compiled code, I'll be very angry and accuse you smelling ugly.


If you are unable to accept a license other than those approved by the Open Source Initiative, you may use these codes using the AFL-3.0 license, instead of complying with this license.

If you choose to accept AFL-3.0, you may need to show in your README or somewhere else that is very convenient to see, you are using the AFL-3.0 license.
